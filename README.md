# PRODIGY_CS_01
## Description
A Simple Caesar Cipher program in Python that encrypts and decrypts a string using a shift value. The code utilizes the ord() function to convert the character into Unicode and add or subtract the number of shifts to shift the characters.

## How to Use
Run the code in an integrated development environment(IDE) or in a terminal using the following command
```
python caesar_cipher.py
```
The program gives you an option to do the following:
1. Encrypt a Plain text to an encrypted text using Caesar cipher
2. Decrypt an Encrypted message to plain text using Caesar cipher
3. Exit the program

Each encryption and decryption allows the user to input a shift value (which can be negative) and a message to decrypt or encrypt.
